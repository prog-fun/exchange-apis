/PART-SEPARATOR/

This is a test-data file. Everything after the part separator will be ignored

First we have subscribed to two markets: BTC/USD and LTC/ETH.
        
Scenario:
We get the following bids and asks at the beginning:
BTC/USD
Bids:
price=701, count=1, amount=61
price=702, count=2, amount=32
Asks:
price=741, count=1, amount=0.8
price=751, count=3, amount=1.2

LTC/ETH:
price=71, count=10, amount=610
price=72, count=20, amount=320
Asks:
price=74, count=10, amount=8
price=75, count=30, amount=12
        
Then the following updates are received for BTC/USD
1) Bid @702 is cancelled
2) New bid @703 arrives, amount=45, count=1
3) Bid @701 is increased by 9 units, remaining amount=70, count=3
4) Bid @701 is decreased by 50 units, remaining amount=20, count=2
5) New ask @761 arrives, amount=2, count=3
6) Ask @751 is increased by 0.8 units, remaining amount=2.0, count=4
7) Ask @751 is decreased by 0.5 units, remaining amount=1.5, count=2
8) Ask @761 is removed

Then we receive updates for LTC/ETH
1) Bid @72 is cancelled
2) New bid @73 arrives, amount=450, count=10
3) Bid @71 is increased by 90 units, remaining amount=700, count=30
4) Bid @71 is decreased by 500 units, remaining amount=200, count=20
5) New ask @76 arrives, amount=20, count=30
6) Ask @75 is increased by 8 units, remaining amount=20, count=40
7) Ask @75 is decreased by 5 units, remaining amount=15, count=20
8) Ask @76 is removed
