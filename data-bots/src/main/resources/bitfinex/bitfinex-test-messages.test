/PART-SEPARATOR/

This is a test-data file. Everything after the part separator will be ignored

Scenario:
We get the following bids and asks at the beginning:
Bids:
price=701, count=1, amount=61
price=702, count=2, amount=32
Asks:
price=741, count=1, amount=0.8
price=751, count=3, amount=1.2

Then the following updates are received:
1) Bid @702 is cancelled
2) New bid @703 arrives, amount=45, count=1
3) Bid @701 is increased by 9 units, remaining amount=70, count=3
4) Bid @701 is decreased by 50 units, remaining amount=20, count=2
5) New ask @761 arrives, amount=2, count=3
6) Ask @751 is increased by 0.8 units, remaining amount=2.0, count=4
7) Ask @751 is decreased by 0.5 units, remaining amount=1.5, count=2
8) Ask @761 is removed


Expected resulting bids and asks are described above, where each row is in the format price,amount,count
